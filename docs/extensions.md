# Extensions
We are going to attempt the following extensions

## Grade
Website says:
Grade 5 / VG: Your code is highly readable, efficient and very well commented, and you have implemented at least two large extensions, which are independent of each other.
 - Which extensions are "large"?

## Clarification Questions
This means:
 - New test cases, that expect one or more clarifying question, answer them, and finally expect ONE interpretation.
 - Ask for properties
   - Finding smallest set of properties that resolve ambiguities.
   - Formulating a question to ask for those properties.
   - ??? New grammar to parse results and interpreter extension.
 - Ask user to decide between different objects
   - Describe objects concisely and readable
     - The red or the green ball/one? (Depending on if the request mentioned a ball)
